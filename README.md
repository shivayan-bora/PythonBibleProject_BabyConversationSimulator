# PythonBibleProject_BabyConversationSimulator

This is the sixth project from the course The Python Bible containing concepts of loops, data structures, conditionals etc.

# Goal:
This is a fun project where a baby will ask a question based on a set of random questions and will keep on asking why until we give the answer as "Just Because".
